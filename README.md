#  Scientific Literature Analysis Project
#### Summer Research Project | May 2024 - July 2024

This project aimed to streamline research analysis by developing a robust system for:

### Automated Article Extraction & Classification:
Extracted 5000+ research articles using web scraping techniques.
Classified articles based on keywords and presence of graphs.
Developed a Machine Learning model for automated text and image extraction.

### Graph Identification & Analysis:
Utilized Pytesseract for text extraction from images.
Implemented the YOLOv8 model for accurate graph identification and classification.
Predicted graphs with 0.95 accuracy, X labels with 0.90, and Y labels with 0.94.
Achieved an F1 score of 0.86 for the trained classification model.

### Research Application: 
Successfully classified over 5000+ Shape Memory Alloy articles, identifying 580 highly relevant articles containing Stress-Strain graphs.

#### Key Technologies: 
Python, Machine Learning, Web Scraping, Image Processing, YOLOv8, Pytesseract
